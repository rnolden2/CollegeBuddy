 * Created by randynolden on 7/25/15.
 * Here is where a user can join and receive updates regarding organizations they're interested in.
 * An Idea is to list all campus orgs where the user can just pick and choose.
 * Once the user joins information can be pushed both ways.
 *
 * This will be updated later after initial launch to add functionality.
